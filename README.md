STEP 1: Set up GitHub to be used on your local machine
  1. Download the GitHub app
  2. Sign in to the app
  3. Create an empty folder on your PC to house our collaborative repository


STEP 2: Clone the repository onto your local machine
  1. Copy the path of the folder you just created
  2. Select the option Clone a repository from the Internet
  3. Find this repository
  4. Paste the local path you copied into the local path thing

STEP 3: Making changes and publishing them to the cloud
  1. Once you make changes to the files on your local drive, the GitHub app should give you a choice to commit your changes to main.
  2. Click commit to main on your GitHub app
  3. Then click push to origin when that shows up.
  4. If any changes are made by the others, you will need to fetch those files by clicking fetch origin on the GitHub app.
  5. Then click Pull


David or I will commit your changes to the Game Center one, so try not to publish any changes to that specific file.
Otherwise, glhf!!
